# Live Example

You can see how this framework works at https://sabaframework.web.app/ address. But before that, you have to register first to become a **saba framework developer.**

# Documentation Online

You can read the guide at the https://saba-framework.gitbook.io/saba-framework-documentation-react-version address which contains what the framework is, how to use it, what are its features, how to customize, and others. The online documentation is still under development so if you don't find what you're looking for in the guide you can ask directly with the _saba framework administrator_ or through the _saba framework community_.
