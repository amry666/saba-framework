This Repository is **Saba Framework React Js Version (Compiled)**. Helping frontend developers to make UI easier and faster. This framework/CMS is very flexible, can be customized and can create various types of CRUD pages such as tables, grids, serverside processes, map markers / polygons, org-charts, gantt charts, expandable tables, relations crud & forms, and many more. Frontend developers don't have to linger too much with writing code to create fields & forms. More details can be read in the online documentation.
